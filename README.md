## Hello, Bevy!

Today is the first day of Daily Bevy.

## Today's example
Today's focus is going to be different, we are going to review a few articles about Camera2dBundle.

The articles:
- https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/graphics/camera.html
- https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/2d/camera.html
- https://taintedcoders.com/bevy/cameras/

### First article
Let's start here: https://taintedcoders.com/bevy/cameras/

This article gives insight about how the different components of the Camera2dBundle work.
Also about what is a Frustum, how to use it and other useful informations.

Also played a bit with mouse movements + positions and also tried to add 2 Camera3d (could be used to have a 3d minimap for example)
